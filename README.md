# DHP
Discord Helper PHP

This project is very much a WIP. I would not recommend using it in its current state.

Uses https://github.com/Exanlv/DHP-Core as a core

# Goal
The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use library to interact with the official discord api (websocket & REST).

# Performance
There is currently no caching for objects. Because of this, performance is not great. For now, implementing some sort of caching does not have a very high priority as it is far from production ready anyway.
